- The idea for this app came from BBC Weather. The app was designed to take the user's latitude and current month to determine if it's summer or winter.

## Description

- Used windows APIs
- Used location
- Created a component to do the calculations
- Another component was fed that information to determine what to show on screen
- Implemented a loader for UX improvement
- Used the context system for passing information down to components
- Mainly focused on styling over logic using Semantic UI
- This had both inline and external CSS file

## What I learnt

- The context system ✅
- Further styling ✅
- Conditional rendering ✅
- Config classes and using props to render items ✅
- React/JavaScript logic ✅
- Troubleshooting using StackOverflow and Google ✅

## How To Use

- Simply activate your locations on your browser. This allows the React logic to be fed and conditionally render summer or winter text and styling.
